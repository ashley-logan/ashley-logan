## Thanks for checking out my GitHub!


#### Who am I?
- Hi! My name's Ashley Logan; she/her
- I'm currently a sophomore at University of Illinois Chicago
- I'm getting my bachelor's degree in Data Science
- 
#### What is my current programming skill set? (updated 8/31/25)
- Proficient in Python, especially working with Pandas, Polars, Async libraries
- Proficient in C++ and C; strong grasp on memory management and safety
- Currently learning Rust (check out my "rustlings" repo to see my progress)
- I'm proficient in html parsing (check out my billboard project) including pattern matching with regular expressions
- I'm proficient in asynchronous programming and have an indepth understanding of the event loop and concurrent tasks
- I have a deep understanding of data transformation and the patterns of etl (and elt) pipelines

#### For potential employers
I'm currently looking for an internship for the Summer of 2026? While I'm currently studying data science, I belive I would excel in any programming-related role since my hobby projects incorperate lots of data engineering and software engineering skill sets. I enjoy performing statistical analysis on data sets as well as engineering low level data pipelines. My billboard repository showcases each step of the etl (extract, transform, load) process and would be a great place to start assessing my viability for a potential role. Thanks for reading!
